# What is Alliage ?

Sounds like a good question, right?<br />
We'll answer it for sure but before that, we prefer to tell you what **Alliage** _IS NOT_ and what it _WON'T_ allow you to do.<br />
This way, we can avoid people with unrealistic or irrelevant expectations wasting their time any further. (No need to thank us üòâ)

## What Alliage _IS NOT_

- üöÄ Surely not a "Game changer"
- üë®‚Äçüéì Certainly not the new thing to learn absolutely
- üí∞ Absolutely not a project backed by a multibillionaire company
- üöß Obviously not an occasion to refactor entirely any of your projects

## What Alliage _WON'T_ allow you to do

- üçÜ Enlarge any part of your body
- üß† Seem smarter in tech discussions
- üí° Solve all the bad design induced issues you have in your projects right now
- ‚è± Reduce drastically the dev time of your projects

## What Alliage _ACTUALLY_ is

If you've not been discouraged by any of the things mentionned above, I guess we can explain you what is **Alliage** and what problem it can solve.

First, we must tell you what is hidden behing the name **Alliage**. It is actually the combination of two projects which are:
- [Alliage Framework](https://github.com/TheHumbleJester/alliage): A fully extendable **micro-framework** allowing you to **compose** your project by combining several small pieces of logic called **module** (what an original name !).
The main idea behind this is to have a project containing **only what is needed** to make it work and also to be able to **share features** in all your projects.
- [Alliage Core](https://github.com/TheHumbleJester/alliage-core): A set of _official_ modules bringing features commonly needed in modern softwares.

_It's not necessary for you to read their documentation right now as the main topics will be adressed in the upcoming tutorial, but don't hesitate to read them afterwards to complete your knowledge._

Well, you've read it, **Alliage** is yet another **framework** even if we don't really like this word as it can designate a lot of completely different things and brings more confusion than enlightenment.<br />
Another reason why we don't like it is because, in the NodeJS world, **framework** often designate a tool allowing you to build web servers and more especially REST APIs.<br />
In a way, you could build such a thing with **Alliage** but it would only cover a small part of its true potential and it would not do it as well as tools like [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) or [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/).
So if building REST APIs is your only need, **Alliage** might not be the best fit for you !

Here, we like to call **Alliage** a **build-anything framework** as it's totally unopinionated and not focused on a specific problematic.<br />
You might find **Alliage** cool if in your daily work you have to build different kind of things while keeping the same development habits and being able to share easily some piece of codes across all of your projects.

Anyway, better than writing a lot of text about the why **Alliage** is cool and you should give it a try, we'll just suggest you to get your hands in it by following this [tutorial](/getting-started) in which we'll show you how to build a... REST API ! (So ironic, isn't it ? üòÖ).
