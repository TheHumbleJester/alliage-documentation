## Unit testing

Looks like we have a working REST API built with the **Alliage Framework**, however this doesn't mean that our job here is done.  
A common good practice in software engineering is to write automated tests to check that any part of our code works properly in an isolated environment.

In this example we'll use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as it's most widely used testing library but what's coming next could totally apply with any other library.  
So we'll start by installing it:

```bash
yarn add -D jest @types/jest ts-jest
```

and we'll create the `jest.config.js` configuration file:

<Code
  fileName="jest.config.js"
  current="18.unit-tests-jest-config/current.txt"
  lang="javascript"
/>

Finally, we can start writing our test.  
We won't necessarily cover all the code, so we'll just focus on the `src/controllers/country-controller.ts` which is the most complex case as it has dependencies on 2 **services**.  

Let's start with the setup of our test file. We're going to create `country-controller.test.ts` file in the `src/controllers/__tests__` directory.

<Code
  fileName="src/controllers/__tests__/country-controller.test.ts"
  current="19.unit-test/part1.txt"
  lang="typescript"
/>

Now we can start writing the first test! Let's begin with the `registerRoutes` method.  
All we need to check here is that it has actually returned a list of two routes: one for the list and one for the detail.

<Code
  fileName="src/controllers/__tests__/country-controller.test.ts"
  current="19.unit-test/part1.txt"
  next="19.unit-test/part2.txt"
  lang="typescript"
  fold
/>

Then, we can test the country list endpoint.
Basically, what we need to check here is that:
- The country service is actually called
- The response body contains what has been returned by the country service

<Code
  fileName="src/controllers/__tests__/country-controller.test.ts"
  current="19.unit-test/part2.txt"
  next="19.unit-test/part3.txt"
  lang="typescript"
  fold
/>

Next, we can focus on the country detail endpoint.  
Unlike the previous endpoint, there will be two scenarios to test here. The one when the given country exists and the one when the given country does not exist.  
First, let's focus on the optimist case. In this one, we must check the following things:
- The country service is called and receive the "countryCode" query parameter
- The wikipedia service is called and receive the country name returned by the country service
- The response body contains the country name and code provided by the country service AND the description provided by the wikipedia service

<Code
  fileName="src/controllers/__tests__/country-controller.test.ts"
  current="19.unit-test/part3.txt"
  next="19.unit-test/part4.txt"
  lang="typescript"
  fold
/>

Finally, we can test the least optimistic scenario in which will check the following things:
- The country service is called and receive the "countryCode" query parameter
- The response code is 404
- The response body contains a "Not found." message.

<Code
  fileName="src/controllers/__tests__/country-controller.test.ts"
  current="19.unit-test/part4.txt"
  next="19.unit-test/part5.txt"
  lang="typescript"
  fold
/>

Once the test has been written, we'll be able to run them but, before that, we have to add a new script in our `package.json` file.

<Code
  fileName="package.json"
  current="20.unit-test-script/current.txt"
  next="20.unit-test-script/next.txt"
  lang="json"
  fold
/>

Also, to avoid any problem during the build, you can also ignore test files in the typescript config:

<Code
  fileName="tsconfig.json"
  current="21.tsconfig-test/current.txt"
  next="21.tsconfig-test/next.txt"
  lang="json"
  fold
/>

Now we're ready to run our test:

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

And, if everything's good it should be all green! âœ…

## Integration testing

Unlike the unit testing, integration testing consists in testing our application as a whole in order to check that the connection between all of our components is working properly.

In our case, doing this would mean starting our webserver and perform requests on it programmatically and check that it respond as exepected.  
We see you grimacing! ðŸ‘€ You certainly think that it would be a tricky thing to do, right ?
Actually, not that much actually thanks to [alliage-sandbox](https://github.com/TheHumbleJester/alliage-sandbox)!

### Install and configure `alliage-sandbox`

This library will allow us to run our **Alliage** application in an **isolated sandbox** directly from your test files.  
Then we'll be able to run our app in an isolated environment, with a specific configuration and in a **close-to-production** condition.

So the first thing we'll do here is to install `alliage-sandbox`:

```bash
yarn add -D alliage-sandbox
```

Then, we'll create a new `integration-tests` folder at the root of the project:

```bash
mkdir integration-tests
```

Next, we'll need to create an **alliage-sandbox** configuration file.  
It must be named `alliage-sandbox-config.json` and we'll create it in the previously created `integration-tests` directory.

<Code
  fileName="integration-tests/alliage-sandbox"
  current="22-alliage-sandbox-config/current.txt"
  lang="json"
/>

So, let's explain what's going on here ! 
First, we must clarify how `alliage-sandbox` work internally.  
Actually, when you initialize a **sandbox** in your test file, it will create a blank **Alliage** project. So what we do here with this config file is to copy the files of our project in the **sandbox**.
This way, the project's sandbox will be a copy of our project and, then, we'll be able to perform tests on it!

So basically here, we tell **alliage-sandbox** to copy the `src` directory, the `config` directory, the `alliage-modules.json` file and the `tsconfig.json` file in the **sandbox**.

You must have noticed the strange syntax `<projectRoot>` in the file paths. This is actually a representation of you project's path.  
There's actually two of them usable in the configuration file which are:
- `<projectRoot>` as explained above
- `<scenarioRoot>` which represents the directory where the `alliage-config.json` file is located. In our case, it's the `integration-tests` directory.

### Improve project's testability

Before starting writing the tests, we must to some little update make our project easily testable.

The first one, will be to use environment variables in our configuration file, like this:

<Code
  fileName="config/parameters.yaml"
  current="23.parameters-env/current.txt"
  next="23.parameters-env/next.txt"
  lang="yaml"
  split
/>

The point of doing this is that, during our tests, we don't want our app to call the actual third-party services but **mocked versions** of them instead.  
So now, we can just override the default configuration by just defining the corresponding env variables which is pretty convenient!

The second update we'll make, will be on the **main process**. We're just going to make it output something in the console when the server is ready.
It will help us to know when we can start making HTTP requests on it.

<Code
  fileName="src/processes/main.ts"
  current="24.main-process-output/current.txt"
  next="24.main-process-output/next.txt"
  lang="typescript"
  fold
/>

### Setup the test

First we're going to setup the test.
What we need to do is to:
- Create and initialize the sandbox
- Make it build the application
- Make it run the web server while overriding the configuration

<Code
  fileName="integration-tests/index.text.ts"
  current="25.integration-test/part1.txt"
  lang="typescript"
/>

### Test a basic endpoint

Now, let's start simple with our first integration test.  
We're going to test the `/` endpoint as this one does not require to call third-party services.

<Code
  fileName="integration-tests/index.text.ts"
  current="25.integration-test/part1.txt"
  next="25.integration-test/part2.txt"
  lang="typescript"
  fold
/>

### Test the country list endpoint

From here, things will get more complex as we need to simulate the country API.  
What we need to do is to start a webserver listening on the random port generated earlier and to implement a dummy version of the `/country/all` endpoint.
For the rest, it will be just like the previous example: We perform a request on our server and check the result.

<Code
  fileName="integration-tests/index.text.ts"
  current="25.integration-test/part2.txt"
  next="25.integration-test/part3.txt"
  lang="typescript"
  fold
/>

### Test the country detail endpoint

Finally, for the detail endpoint il will be the same process except that, this time, we have to mock to APIs instead of just one:

<Code
  fileName="integration-tests/index.text.ts"
  current="25.integration-test/part3.txt"
  next="25.integration-test/part4.txt"
  lang="typescript"
  fold
/>

### Run the tests

Now that we have written the tests, we're going to run them!
But before, we're going to create a **jest** configuration file called `jest.config.integration.js` especially for the integration tests. It will simply extend the first one and override the test files pattern:

<Code
  fileName="jest.config.integration.js"
  current="26.jest-config-integration/current.txt"
  lang="javascript"
/>

Also, we're going to create a new script in the `package.json` to be able to run integration tests:

<Code
  fileName="jest.config.integration.js"
  current="27.package-integration-script/current.txt"
  next="27.package-integration-script/next.txt"
  lang="json"
  fold
/>

And finally, we can run the test by running the following command:

```bash
yarn test:integration
```

That's it! If everything went fine, it should be all green! âœ…

### About the sandbox

You've certainly noticed that the sandbox API is pretty low level and requires some additional code to make things work like we want.  
That's because, as the **Alliage framework**, the sandbox is not opinionated and is made to work for all kind of **Alliage projects**.
That said, nothing prevent you from creating your own wrapper around it to make it more convenient to test the kind of project you want to build.

## Create a reusable module

In this documentation we kept telling you that **Alliage** allows you to easily share code in all of you application without ever telling you in what way exactly.  
We weren't bullshitting you! We just wanted to save the best for last ðŸ˜œ

There are a lot of obvious reasons why sharing code across all of your projects is interesting, but here are the most valuable reasons to our eyes:
- It avoids code duplication in all of your projects:
  - Each shared feature is maintained at one single place
  - Updates are easier to spread
  - Code is tested once
- It makes your project free of technical things and more focused on business logic
  - Modules are ideal to encapsulate purely technical features that are likely to be reused in other projects
  - Avoiding mixing technical logic and business logic makes things easier to understand

### Extract reusable components

Now, let's think about what part of our code could be encapsulated in a shareable module ðŸ¤”
If we look closer at our code, the only part that has the best chance to be reausable would be everything related to the web server:
- The **abstract controller**
- The **main process**: which is in charge of loading the controllers and launching the web server

So, let's roll ou sleeves and move them in a separate module! ðŸ’ª

Usually, **Alliage modules** are not meant to be loaded locally from the project itself but it's pretty useful to do so for testing purpose.  
So, the first thing we'll do is to create a `modules/web-server` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p modules/web-server
```

Let's move the **main process** and the **abstract controller** in that new folder:

```bash
## MainProcess (we rename in web.ts in the process)
mkdir modules/web-server/processes
mv src/processes/main.ts modules/web-server/processes/web.ts

## AbstractController
mkdir modules/web-server/controllers
mv src/controllers/abstract-controller.ts modules/web-server/controllers/index.ts
```

Of course, we'll need to update the `MainController` and the `CountryController` change the import path of the `AbstractController`:

<Code
  fileName="src/controllers/main-controller.ts"
  current="28.webserver-module/current-main-controller.txt"
  next="28.webserver-module/next-main-controller.txt"
  lang="typescript"
  fold
/>

<Code
  fileName="src/controllers/country-controller.ts"
  current="28.webserver-module/current-country-controller.txt"
  next="28.webserver-module/next-country-controller.txt"
  lang="typescript"
  fold
/>


We'll also need to make some little updates on the `MainProcess` which will rename in `WebProcess`:

<Code
  fileName="modules/web-server/processes/web.ts"
  current="28.webserver-module/process-part1.txt"
  next="28.webserver-module/process-part2.txt"
  lang="typescript"
  fold
/>

We have also replaced the default import with a named import and removed the `Service` decorator as the modules' services are not autoloaded.

Finally, we must create the module class which must be located at the root of the module directory and in a `index.ts` file.
This module class will allow, inter alia, to register the `MainProcess` as a service.

<Code
  fileName="modules/web-server/processes/web.ts"
  current="28.webserver-module/module-part1.txt"
  lang="typescript"
/>

### Create the package

**Alliage modules** being node packages, we'll need to create a `package.json` file:

```
cd modules/web-server
yarn init
```

Also, node packages are usually written in pure JavaScript so we'll have to compile the TypeScript code beforehand:

```bash
yarn add -D typescript # We install typescript
$(npm bin)/tsc --init # We create a tsconfig.json file
$(npm bin)/tsc # We compile the code
```

Finally, we must make the module installable. For this we have to add an `alliageManifest` property in the `package.json` file:

<Code
  fileName="modules/web-server/package.json"
  current="28.webserver-module/package-manifest-part1.txt"
  next="28.webserver-module/package-manifest-part2.txt"
  lang="json"
/>

Well, we guess this deserves some explanations! 
The `alliageManifest` property just contain some metadata required by the [alliage-module-installer](https://github.com/TheHumbleJester/alliage-core/tree/master/packages/module-installer) module to install a module automatically.  
There's two main property here:
- `type`: The value is `module` because... it's a module 
- `dependencies`: The purpose of this information is to enable the `alliage-module-installer` module to make sure that all the module dependencies are installed before installing the module itself.  
  Also, at the runtime, it also ensures that all module dependencies are loaded before loading the module itself.  
  You might wonder: _How do we know what dependencies we must define for a module ?_
  In our case, we define the `alliage-di`, `alliage-lifecycle` and `alliage-process-manager` as dependencies because we import some of their components in the code of our module.  
  Regarding `alliage-module-installer`, it's simply because it's the module in charge of installing our own module, so we need to make sure that this module is installed and loaded before ours.

### Create a dedicated config file

We could start using our module right now but there's actually still room for improvement.  
You may have noticed the `WebProcess` still have a dependency on the parameter `parameters.webserver.port`. It works fine like this but if the user remove the `webserver.port` property from the `config/parameters.yaml` file he will get an error that is not really self-explanatory.

A better practice when it comes to provide the user the ability to configure our module is to have a dedicated configuration file for it.  
It just required a bit more code but it is worth it as it bring pretty cool benefits:
- A default config file can be created at the module's installation which lighten the installation process for the user.
- We can validate the format of the config file and thus provide more explicit errors when the user does a mistake.

The first step is to update the module's class to load and validate the config file:

<Code
  fileName="modules/web-server/index.ts"
  current="28.webserver-module/module-part1.txt"
  next="28.webserver-module/module-part2.txt"
  lang="typescript"
  fold
/>

Then, we must create the default configuration file, that will be automatically created in the project at the module's installation:

<Code
  fileName="modules/web-server/base-files/config.yaml"
  current="28.webserver-module/config.txt"
  lang="typescript"
  yaml
/>

Next, we must update the `alliageManifest` in the `package.json` of our module to tell `alliage-module-installer` to copy the configuration file in the `config` folder at the module installation.

<Code
  fileName="modules/web-server/package.json"
  current="28.webserver-module/package-manifest-part2.txt"
  next="28.webserver-module/package-manifest-part3.txt"
  lang="json"
/>

And as you can see above:
- We've added the [alliage-config-loader]() module as dependency as, as it's name suggests it, it's the module in charge of loading the configuration files.
- We've added the `installationProcedures.copyFiles` property which will copy the config file from the module to the project at the installation

Finally, don't forget to recompile the code ðŸ˜‰

```bash
$(npm bin)/tsc
```

### Install and use the module

Now that the module is ready, you'll be able to install it by running the following command:

```bash
yarn alliage:install ./modules/web-server
```

You should notice that a new entry has been added in the `alliage-modules.json` file and that a new `config/webserver.yaml` file has been created.  
Now you can check that everything's alright by running the following command:

```bash
yarn alliage:run:dev web
```

It should start your server and everything should work the same way as before! 

### Publish the package

Now that we've tested our module locally, it's time for us to publish it!

First, just remove the entry corresponding to your local module in the `alliage-modules.json` file:

<Code
  fileName="alliage-modules.json"
  current="29.module-publish/alliage-modules-part1.txt"
  next="29.module-publish/alliage-modules-part2.txt"
  lang="json"
  fold
/>

Then, create an account on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/signup) and login in your terminal with your credentials:

```bash
npm login
```

Finally, go in your module's directory and publish your package:

```bash
cd modules/web-server
npm publish
```

Now that your package is published, you can go back in you project's directory and install it this way:

```bash
cd ../..
yarn install-modules [your module's name]
```

The `install-modules` script is actually a shorthand for the following commands:

```bash
yarn add [your module's name]
yarn alliage:install [your module's name]
```

## Conclusion

Well, looks like you've reached the end of this documentation, congratz! ðŸ¥³
But this doesn't mean your journey with **Alliage** stops here!

Now you can start practicing a bit more and maybe build awesome projects with it!
You can also consolidate your knowledge of it by having a look at the documentations of:
- [Alliage](https://github.com/TheHumbleJester/alliage): The engine under the hood of the **Alliage framework**
- [alliage-core](https://github.com/TheHumbleJester/alliage-core): The core modules of the **Alliage framework**
- [alliage-typescript](https://github.com/TheHumbleJester/alliage-typescript): The module bringing the **TypeScript** syntax in your **Alliage** projects.

Have fun! ðŸ‘‹
